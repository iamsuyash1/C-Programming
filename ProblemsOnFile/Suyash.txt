Important points

The file needs to be opened for write operations
buf needs to be at least as long as specified by cnt because if buf size less than the cnt then buf will lead to the overflow condition.
cnt is the requested number of bytes to write, while the return value is the actual number of bytes written. This happens when fd have a less number of bytes to write than cnt.
If write() is interrupted by a signal, the effect is one of the following:
-If write() has not written any data yet, it returns -1 and sets errno to EINTR.
-If write() has successfully written some data, it returns the number of bytes it wrote before it was interrupted
